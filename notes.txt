NOTES FROM DEMO (14th Feb)

• The main purpose:
  - Retrieve the odds from API, process it, and display them on the application
  - Most of this will be proof of concept, however, try and get as much done as possible

• Add some more information to each li result to display what the sport is
  and what time it is on

• Possibly change the result list to reduce scrolling and make it 4 items for each chunk

• Use a hover effect for help image, instead of separate text - CSS3

• Add a disclaimer about GambleAware and the risk of betting
  - related to "£10 will win £22"
  - this will also drive the users to gamble a little more
  - Mention this in the report

• Adapt to wearables i.e. watch
  - run in simulator and gather results for report
    • include an appendix with the result of the emulator along with the code snippet
  - Possibly in version 2.0 of artefact

• Ask Betfair to use their live access key and mention its only for University

• Make sure to ask Alex and Ann for tips on how to improve project (either report or artefact)

• To achieve a higher mark, discuss new ways to look at things and solve problems
  - methodology, look at how I adapted multiple methodologies to create the ideal one for my project
  - Discuss this in the report to achieve a much higher mark
